description: In 2014, the then mayor of Barcelona challenged cities to produce everything they consume by 2054. Fab City Global Initiative is enabling this shift away from the industrial paradigm of Product-in Trash-out, by enabling the return of manufacture to cities supported by a Data-in Data-out urban model. It comprises a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#global-initiative">Network</a> of 38 cities, a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#fab-city-collective">core Collective </a> and is governed by a foundation. We are working to make locally productive, globally connected cities and citizens.
